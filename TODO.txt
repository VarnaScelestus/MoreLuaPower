DONE:
    Custom Hooks aren't passing the item correctly
    Optional argument for custom hooks for the being
    add a hook to when Card Drops are randomly generated that, when a spell is chosen if that spell had the Param 'DropCheck', it will attempt to run the function DropCheck states; that function must return a boolean. If true, its allowed to drop

PRIORITY:
    CreateAudio(string name, string soundName, bool loop), PlayAudio(string name), PauseAudio(string name), and StopAudio(string name), ToggleLoopAudio
    Have a <DropCheck> tag for artifacts and spells that makes sure the spell/artifact can appear
    make custom statuses work with XML checks (make it work like brands)
        add the status to Check
    setting custom effect replaces parameters

TODO:
    custom AmountType s
    custom Check s
    custom Tag s (set from xml)
    AI XML (states (string) are moved to and from because of Actions and Interrupts - Actions get chosed randomly within a state (can be weighted), Interrupts are triggered whenever an FTrigger activates and the check passes)
    Add custom settings
    Hooks for world gen
    Reverse engineer the menus
    Let the "num" variable for worlds accept strings so that conflicts are easier to avoid
    Add grid modification stuff
    add more math to XML rather than just addition
    add appending to XML
    Add custom check for brands
    Custom Trigger Stuff:
        Add a Harmony patch that runs after DeckCtrl.RemoveArtifactCard(cardToRemove) and pass the cardToRemove to custom code based on custom triggers
        last PROJECTILE that hit the being
        multiple inputs for cases like OnHit that have different objects, like the projectile that hit
        maybe make the system general enough that people can do those on their own?
    implement the rest of ParticleSystem
    Look into sprite swapping
    add example file
    add credits to credits
    if the effect won't parse, make it call a lua function of the same name
    levels of logging

LOOK INTO:
    input system
    multiple weapons
    this.duelDisk.currentCardtridges.Remove(this.cardtridgeFill);
    custom save properties
    custom buttons
    changing the number of cast slots
    adding mod name to script variable
    patching script bytecode on the fly. Because why not.
